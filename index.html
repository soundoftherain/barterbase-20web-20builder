    <h2 style="font-size:2rem; margin-bottom:1rem; text-align:center; color:#4CAF50;">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      BarterBase DAO is building resilience step by step. We begin focused, grow responsibly, and always keep the long view.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#FFD700;">Phase One — Protection & Marketplace</h3>
    <p>
      We start with EMP and solar-flare protection for laptops, phones, radios, and satellite devices.
      Alongside this, we are building a marketplace for buying, selling, and bartering preparedness gear.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#FFD700;">Phase Two — Food & Water Security</h3>
    <p>
      Expanding into long-term food production, preservation, and water solutions. Education will be a core focus — helping people become less dependent on fragile systems.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem; color:#FFD700;">Phase Three — Tokenized Assets</h3>
    <p>
      In the future, we will explore tokenized digital assets, NFTs, and rural land — after regulation and legal frameworks are in place.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:2rem; font-style:italic;">
      <strong>From the founder (Noah Moses, pseudonym):</strong><br>
      We’re building a community that educates, prepares, and rises together. Now is the time to put our heads down and build the foundation. Much love.
